## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) running locally **OR** a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) cluster
- `npm` (comes with Node.js)

### 2. Install Dependencies
Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

npm install mongodb

### 3. Populate the Database
Run the provided script to insert sample book data:

node insert_books.js

- This will connect to your MongoDB server and populate the `plp_bookstore` database with a `books` collection.

### 4. Run MongoDB Queries
You can run the queries in `queries.js` using the MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`):

1. Start the shell:
    ```
    mongosh
    ```
2. Switch to the database:
    ```
    use plp_bookstore
    ```
3. Copy and paste queries from `queries.js` into the shell to execute them.
